                    These games for the March Madness Tournament have been very good. Even though my bracket got busted when Kentucky lost in the first round, there have been some major upsets. The main one being the NC Sate Wolfpack who have been dominating since the ACC Conference tournamnet. They just beat Duke and they face Purdue next. We'll see how they do.

                    On the other side, Purdue just beat Tennessee. That game was very hard to watch. Zach Edey is 7'4 and he was getting every single foul when the opposing team barely touched him. I really wanted Tennessee to win but it is what it is.
